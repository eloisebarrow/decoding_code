# Decoding Code: A Software Engineering Study Guide

## Project Description

Decoding Code is a study guide for software engineering students. On arriving at the site, users can browse all topics, or decks, and peruse one or more topics to study. Each deck has dedicated flashcards with a prompt on one side (a term or question) and an answer (definition or explanation) on the other side. The site will, by default, show the prompt first.

For more in depth studying, users can create an account to save decks they want to revisit as well as create their own decks. 

Topics will include:

- General Programming
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Express.js
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby on Rails
- Git and Github
- Data Types

This website will be built mobile-first with a React front end, a Rails backend and the database will be built using PostgreSQL.

User Stories: 

- A current Software Engineering student is trying to get straight the React lifecycle methods. They enter Decoding Code, locate the React deck and flip through flashcards on their train ride home.
- A recent graduate of a Software Engineering bootcamp has a big interview to prepare for and they need to brush up on their general programming knowledge like MVC and oh yeah, what's a Promise again? They come to Decoding Code and review the General Programming deck as well as some SQL flashcards for good measure.
- A user preparing to take a course in Software Engineering wants to study prior to their course so they can hit the ground running. They create an account on Decoding Code and save a couple of decks related to what they'll be studying - JavaScript and CSS. Partway through their course, they return to Decoding Code to drill what they've learned and find they no longer need to review the same two subjects. They remove the two decks, browse the available topics and, knowing they'll be learning backend frameworks soon, save Ruby on Rails and Express.js to their decks.

## API

I'll be creating a unique RESTful API which will ultimately be hosted on Heroku.

## Installation Instructions

TBD - ?

## MVP

- A Ruby/Rails server
- RESTful API database seeded with at least 2 prompts/questions per topic
- 3 database tables including users, decks and cards
- Backend routes to view all decks, all cards, one deck and one card
- Backend routes to register, login and verify a user
- React frontend that includes a components folder with CSS files for each component
- An API helper file for each of the corresponding backend controllers
- A thoughtful color palette, graphics, a distinct logo, and an appropriate font for all content

## PostMVP

- Super cool flashcard animation
- Ability for users to create their own flashcards and decks
- An option where users can flip through definitions first to determine the answer/prompt on the other side of the card (the site's default will be the reverse)

## React Component Hierarchy

- [React architecture - TBD]()

## Components

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
|  | | 
|  | | 
|  | | 


| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  |  | |  |  |
|  |  | |  |  |
| Total |  |  |  |  |

## Additional Libraries

Backend: 
- Axios
- JSON Web Token
- CORS
